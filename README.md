# minesort

A small plugin for [paper-based](https://papermc.io/) minecraft servers. It allows players to sort chests or their
inventories. 

## Functionality
Players can double-click a chest (or their inventory) to sort it. The plugin will also try to combine stacks of 
item if there's space left. When sorting inventories, the hotbar/armor/crafting area/left hand slots are all ignored.

## Compatibility
The plugin has only been tested on a small paper server running minecraft 1.21.
